## ‚ö° Event-Driven Design

- Listens to Kafka topic for product deletion events.  
- Automatically deletes all reviews related to a deleted product.  
- Decouples ReviewMS from ProductMS.  
- Ensures data consistency without direct service-to-service calls.

- Kafka ensures eventual consistency on product deletion.  
- Stateless design with JWT-based authentication handled by other microservices.
